## Get started

## Making Components:
Here I have made five diffrent components for 4 different screen + one component for Top Nav :
TopnavComponent-- top nav bar
ProjectdtlsComponent--screen-1
ProjectcostComponent--screen-2
ProjectdatesComponent--screen-3
ProjectgalleryComponent--screen-4
Importance-- code can easily be managed and can be reused.

## Adding Routing
Moving from one component to another is done using Angular Routing.For this I have added path and component in app-routing.module.ts.
Click function called on top nav menu that is actually swiching these components using Router class.

## Angular Material
Here date field can be implemented using Angular Date picker. This is part of Angular material.
